# Catpants

Password strength calculator on key up...with a cat emoji if your password is good enough.
Everyone needs a strength calculator, everyone loves emoji's.  Win win here!  Vanilla javascript meow ðŸ˜»!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

### **** Specify gem version  ****

```ruby
gem 'catpants', '2.5.0'
```

And execute:
```ruby
$ bundle
```

## Usage

You need to require this in app.js
```ruby
//= require catpants
```

You must have a html label element for the password field with a class of `catpants`.
```html
<label class="catpants">
```
And a class of `catpants-password` on the password input
```html
<input class="catpants-password">
```
Here's a RAILS example with form helpers
```html
<div class="form-group">
  <%= label_tag :password, "Password", class:"catpants" %>
  <%= password_field_tag :password, "", class: "catpants-password" %>
</div>
```
RAILS with Simple Form example
```erb
<%= f.input :password, label_html: { class: 'catpants' }, input_html: {class:'catpants-password'} %>
```



Boom. Done.
