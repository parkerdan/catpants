# Catpants

Password strength calculator on key up...with a cat emoji if your password is good enough.
Everyone needs a strength calculator, everyone loves emoji's.  Win win here!  No longer relies on jQuery, vanilla javascript meow ðŸ˜»!

I believe both versions are in good working order if you follow the instructions laid out below.  If you encounter any errors, please notify me but be certain your usage is in accordance with the documentaion below.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

### **** Specify gem version  ****

```ruby
gem 'catpants', '2.2.0'
```

And execute:
```ruby
$ bundle
```

## Usage

You need to require this in app.js
```ruby
//= require catpants
```

You must have a html label element for the password field with id of catpants.
```html
<label id="catpants" for="password">
```
and an id of password on the password input
```html
<input type="password" name="password" id="password" value="" class="form-control">
```
Here's a RAILS example with form helpers
```html
<div class="form-group">
  <%= label_tag :password, "Password", id:"catpants" %>
  <%= password_field_tag :password, "", class: "form-control" %>
</div>
```
RAILS with Simple Form example
```erb
<%= f.input :password, label_html: { id: 'catpants' }, input_html: {id:'password'} %>
```



Boom. Done.
